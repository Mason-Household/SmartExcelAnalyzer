## Reporting a Vulnerability

You can always open an issue on here if it isn't something sensitive. Idk how it could be something sensitive, but if it could bring the whole project down or something
I would really appreciate it if you would email me at connor.mason@fivemconsulting.com whenever you get a chance! I have nothing to give you but my respect and appreciation.
